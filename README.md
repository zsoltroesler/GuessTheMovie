# GuessTheMovie
1st project of UdacityÂ´s [Object Oriented Programming in Java](https://www.udacity.com/course/Object-Oriented-Programming-in-Java) course

The program randomly picks a movie title from a text file that contains a large list of movies and shows you how many letters it's made up of. Your goal is to try to figure out the movie by guessing one letter at a time. If a letter is indeed in the title the computer will reveal its correct position in the word, if not, you lose a point. If you use the same incorrect letter, you will be warned it's already used and you won't lose another point. If you lose 10 points, game over!
